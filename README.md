🎶 Spotify Listening Behavior Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a large-scale Spotify listening dataset containing ~150k play events. The goal is to uncover user listening patterns, music preferences, and engagement behaviors across tracks, artists, and platforms. Insights from this analysis can support music recommendations, user retention strategies, and platform optimization.
🛠️ Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) → Data cleaning, exploration & visualization
MySQL → Querying large-scale data & extracting insights
Power BI / Tableau → Dashboard creation for interactive reporting
Excel → Quick summary statistics & validation
🎯 Key Objectives
Analyze listening duration and detect skip behavior.
Identify most played tracks, artists, and albums.
Explore platform usage trends (Web Player, Mobile, etc.).
Study user engagement patterns (shuffle, autoplay, click-based listening).
Discover temporal trends – how listening behavior changes over time.
🔑 Key Findings (Sample Insights)
🎵 Top Artists: Calvin Harris, Lana Del Rey, and The Mowgli’s appeared frequently among high-play tracks.
⏱️ Average Listening Time: Most users listened to 60–70% of a track before skipping or ending playback.
📱 Platform Trends: The web player dominated early listening logs, but mobile use increased steadily.
⏯️ Skip Behavior: Tracks started via autoplay had higher skip rates than manually clicked tracks.
